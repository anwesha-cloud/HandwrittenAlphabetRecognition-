Handwritten Alphabet Recognition (Webcam Version)-2022
⚠️ Note: This is a very old Python project written with older versions of OpenCV, scikit-learn, and Pillow.
If you are running it today, you may need to update deprecated functions, handle warnings, and install compatible library versions for it to work smoothly.

This project is a real-time handwritten alphabet recognition tool that uses your webcam to detect and classify the handwritten English alphabet (A–Z).
It uses a Logistic Regression model trained on grayscale image data stored locally (image.npz and labels.csv) to make predictions
